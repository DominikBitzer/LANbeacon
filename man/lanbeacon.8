.SH DESCRIPTION		\" TODO more info
.PP
In sending mode, \fBLAN-Beacon\fR periodically sends out a Ethernet-frames over all network interfaces or one selected interface. The frame contains all of the information that it was given using the parameters stated above.
.PP
In receiving mode, \fBLAN-Beacon\fR periodically checks all network interfaces for LAN-Beacon frames and evaluates all known TLV subtypes. Generally it will print out the received information on the standard output, if it is run on a microcomputer that supports the C-Berry display it will show the information there.
.PP
In case new frames arrive, it will update it's information that is being put out on the screen.
.PP
Receiving from multiple VLANs at once is supported.

.SH EXAMPLES
To write some text to the standard output, use the
.BR printf (1)
command:
.PP
.nf
.RS
printf "this is a %s format %s\n" \\
usual string
.RE
.fi
.PP
Nifty, huh?


.\".nf turns off paragraph filling mode: we don't want that for showing command lines.
.\".fi turns it back on.
.\".RS starts a relative margin indent: examples are more visually distinguishable if they're indented.
.\".RE ends the indent.

.SH COMPILING
.PP 
Use ./configure, make and make install for normal computers
.PP 
use make bananaLANbeacon to enable C-Berry support
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Keys?!
